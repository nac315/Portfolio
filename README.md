Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my work in Data Science, including various projects, analysis, and research that I have worked on throughout my academic career.
Note About Notebook Rendering:
GitHub does not render Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) in the standard way, so if you want to view my notebooks properly, 
I recommend using nbviewer. Simply paste the URL of the notebook on GitHub into nbviewer, and you will be able to see the full notebook.
