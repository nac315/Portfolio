Practice Exercise



Assignment 2
General:
- Please review the comments from the previous exercise regarding following the instructions carefully. (Re: Title of the YAML)
- Proof read carefully. The method is 'Kriging' not 'Kriggin'.
- Code should not be in the output. In class we discussed a workaround to ensure that messages do not appear in the output. Please see me if you have questions about this.
- Page 3. You should not have 'floating plots' without commentary.
- Missing the accompanying variance plot for Ordinary Kriging.
